Train a computer to recognize your own images, sounds, &amp;amp; poses.
A fast, easy way to create machine learning models for your sites, apps, and more – no expertise or coding required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;구글에서 제공하는 Teachable machine을 활용하면 코딩없이 머신러닝 모델을 만들 수 있다. 연예인 사진 데이터를 크롤링해 학습 데이터로 활용하면 동물상테스트나 관상테스트 같은 사이트에 사용된 머신러닝 모델을 만들 수 있는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachable machine을 활용해 머신러닝 모델을 만드는 방법은 간단하다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Project 를 생성한다. 이 때 가장 먼저 Image project인지 Audio project 인지  Pose Project 인지 선택한다.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image Project를 선택한 경우 웹캠을 활용하거나 업로드 방식을 통해 직접 모은 사진 데이터를 업로드해 학습 데이터로 활용할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;클래스별로 나눈 이미지 데이터를 업로드한 다음 Train model을 눌러 트레이닝한다.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preview를 통해 원하는 모델이 만들어졌는지 확인한다. 이 때 사람 얼굴을 학습한 사진이면 전신보다는 얼굴에만 포커스된 사진들만 모아 학습 데이터로 활용해야 정확도가 높아진다. preview로 확인한 아웃풋이 만족스럽지 않은 경우 학습 데이터를 다시 모으거나 클리닝해 재학습하는 것이 필요한다. 학습 데이터의 조건이 동일할수록 이를테면 사람 얼굴을 학습하는 경우 얼굴이 확대된 흑백 사진으로 통일한다거나 해야 정확도가 높아진다.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Export Model을 누르면 만든 머신러닝 모델을 다운로드 할 수 있는 압축파일이 제공된다. 혹은 직접 다운로드하지 않고 웹이나 앱에 붙일 수 있도록 javascript 링크를 복사해도 된다.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teachablemachine의 활용 방안은 무궁무진하다. 예를 들어 식물이나 동물 사진을 학습한 모델을 만들어 식물 맞추기, 동물 맞추기 같은 교육 웹이나 앱을 만들 수도 있을 것이다. 모델을 만드는데 어떤 코딩도 필요하지 않으니 기존에 머신러닝 모델을 직접 만드는데 필요했던 수고를 덜어주는 것만은 분명한 것 같다. teachablemachine는 더 빠르고 다양하게 프로토타입을 제작해본다거나 빨리 출시해 테스트해보는 린한 프로젝트들에 확실히 유용할 것으로 보인다.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Teachable Machine Train a computer to recognize your own images, sounds, &amp;amp; poses.

&lt;p&gt;국가 통제 상황을 벗어나 일년에 수백 퍼센트(%) 이상 물가 상승이 일어나는 경우를 하이퍼인플레이션이라고 한다. 베네수엘라는 2015년 이후 유가 폭락과 정부 부패로 국가 법정 화폐인 볼리바의 가치가 급락하면서 하이퍼인플레이션을 맞이한다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;언젠가 봤던 kbs의 다큐멘터리에서 빵 하나를 사기 위해 돈을 자루에 담아 수레에 싣고 가던 베네수엘라 사람들의 모습이 스쳐간다. 미국 1달러를 구매하기 위해 필요한 볼리마 금액이 2018년 기준 약 100볼리바였던 것에 비해 2019년 이후에는 1600 볼리바 이상으로 폭등했다. 베네수엘라 부유층은 달러를 구입해 화폐로 사용 및 소유하고 있고, 일반 서민층 및 대다수 사람들은 자국 화폐인 볼리바의 대체 화폐로 이오스와 같은 암호 화폐를 일상에서 사용중이다. 최근 비트코인의 변동성이 극대화되면서 하루 등락폭이 요즘과 같이 커지기 전까지 이오스는 가격 변동성이 비교적 크지 않은 스테이블(stable)한 코인에 속하긴 했다. 거래소 간 환전 목적의 화폐로 주로 사용되기도 했으니 말이다.&lt;br /&gt;
택시, 상점 등에 ‘이오스 받아요(aceptamos eos)’ 와 같은 표식이 버젓이 붙은 걸 보면 거짓말만은 전혀 아닌 것 같다.  베네수엘라처럼 하이퍼인플레이션에 따라 법정 통화 가치가 급락하는 경우가 더 많아지면 암호화폐가 기존 자국 화폐를 대체하는 상황이 늘어날 것으로 보인다. 특히 경제 상황이 좋지 않은 베네수엘라 근처 다른 중남미 국가들을 중심으로 이와 같은 현상이 확산할 수 있다. 중남미 국가 중 브라질에 이어 경제 대국 2위에 해당하는 멕시코의 법정 화폐인 페소(peso) 가치 역시 2017년 1원에 60페소 정도였으나 지금 10% 정도 하락한 54페소를 기록하고 있다. 코로나 여파로 인한 경기 부양을 위해 완화된 통화정책이 일년 넘게 지속되고 있는 지금, 떨어지는 화폐 가치에 대한 경계의 필요성을 베네수엘라의 이오스 사용 사례가 잘 보여주는 것 같다.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">‘이오스 받아요(ACEPTAMOS EOS)’</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bitcoin Whales Are a Mixed Blessing</title><link href="https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/bitcoin-whales-are-a-mixed-blessing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bitcoin Whales Are a Mixed Blessing" /><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2021-03-01T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/bitcoin-whales-are-a-mixed-blessing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/bitcoin-whales-are-a-mixed-blessing.html">&lt;p&gt;No sooner did Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warn about Bitcoin’s inefficiency early last week than the cryptocurrency prices tanked. They were already falling, yet, for some, the price movement was a demonstration of the exact volatility Yellen was criticizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For others, like Square and MicroStrategy Inc., it was an opportunity to buy the dip, with words of encouragement from Ark Investment Fund’s Cathie Wood, a Bitcoin bull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bitcoin’s corporate investors will improve price stability. 1 At the same time, the rise of concentrated corporate holdings could pose a different kind of risk.
One wry criticism of Bitcoin is that its userbase resembles the distribution of wealth in North Korea: Just 2% of Bitcoin accounts hold 95% of the cryptocurrency in circulation. While technically true, these figures are also misleading. 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 6.5 million Bitcoin addresses that control at least $100 worth of Bitcoin. In comparison, 43 million users rely on Coinbase to hold over $100 billion worth of Bitcoin. (Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto currency exchange, announced plans last week to go public.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three largest Bitcoin addresses are controlled by cryptocurrency exchanges serving tens of millions of users. While Bitcoin makes it easy for anyone to be their own bank, the fact that the vast majority of Bitcoin users prefer to let third parties take custody of their assets sort of defeats the purpose of a decentralized cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was designed to minimize reliance on corruptible human organizations. In the early days, each user was expected to run their own copy of the software, which would serve as wallet, miner, accountant and auditor. As long as everyone independently verified new transactions, the network would remain secure against censorship and counterfeit spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate treasuries are less likely to manage their own funds. 3 It’s a matter of practicality. Bitcoin is a bearer instrument, and the industry is rife with stories of users who carelessly lost millions of dollars in a dumpster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor compares Bitcoin self-custody to handling an explosive device: “It’s like finding three of your employees and giving each one some nitroglycerin. ‘Take this home with you and bring it back in the morning. The three of you be careful, and don’t get too close to each other. And don’t drop it.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Bitcoin isn’t a physical coin, or even a digital one. It’s a global accounting book where participants follow the same set of rules. In theory, those who run their own Bitcoin software are immune to unauthorized tampering with the protocol. In practice, money is a social construct. It’s not enough for a sovereign individual to maintain their own ledger; others must agree to the same ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A medium of exchange has value if people accept it for things of value. Acceptance doesn’t have to be voluntary; in the U.S. we have legal tender laws. In the absence of government coercion, Bitcoin nodes support the network’s consensus rules by engaging in economic activity. The power to control the protocol is held by those willing to take Bitcoin in exchange for goods, services, or release from ransomware.
This control became apparent in 2017, when the founder of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust organized a group of Bitcoin corporate execs to propose a controversial change to the core protocol. The modification seemed harmless — it would double the number of transactions recorded per minute on the blockchain — but as a backward-incompatible rule change, the modification would split the network and potentially leave two separate cryptocurrencies jockeying for the identity of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin merchants and exchanges resisted, and signaled their opposition to the change. These economic participants threatened to reject any transactions that failed to follow their preferred protocol, effectively boycotting the modification. The agreement was eventually abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has floated the possibility that Tesla will allow customers to pay for their cars with Bitcoin. In doing so, Tesla will have far more influence over the Bitcoin protocol than it does by merely holding $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, corporate interest in Bitcoin is motivating traditional financial institutions to get with the program. BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank with over $2 trillion in assets under management, has announced an initiative to provide infrastructure for cryptocurrencies. Mastercard and Visa are coming around as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only five years ago, the idea of Bitcoin-as-a-corporate-asset would have been met with eyerolls and derision. Institutional adoption is a sign of Bitcoin’s maturity, but its impact could potentially dwarf the preferences of smaller, independent users in the event of future protocol disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if Bitcoin is to become a sovereign currency that overthrows legacy banking, it needs the price stability that comes from being on a lot of institutional balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Goldman Sachs economist Jeff Currie: “The key to creating some type of stability in the market is to see an increase in the participation of institutional investors and right now they’re small.” He speculates that roughly 1% of the money invested in Bitcoin right now is institutional money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Bitcoin account holdings are public, the addresses are pseudonymous. Like everything else on the Internet, there’s no way to know who controls which Bitcoin account, or how many accounts a person has, or whether an account is even controlled by a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a $750 billion company, Tesla turned to Coinbase for its recent Bitcoin purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">No sooner did Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warn about Bitcoin’s inefficiency early last week than the cryptocurrency prices tanked.

For context, I’m a contributor to Cortex, an open source platform for deploying models in production.
If you’re a developer, you probably have at least a passing interest in machine learning. The concept of algorithms that can teach themselves to make predictions is just kind of… cool.
However, if you do decide to study ML and follow the canonical recommendations for getting started, there’s a decent chance you’ll spend two weeks learning linear algebra and multivariable calculus before giving up.
The reason for this is that most introductory material for machine learning isn’t geared towards developers, it’s geared to ML researchers—and this is an issue for developers who just want to build products with machine learning.
Do you want to build products, or do research?
Prior to the late 2000s, machine learning was more or less exclusively a research problem. There simply weren’t many companies using machine learning in production in a meaningful way.
As such, a lot of the introductory material available for machine learning approaches it from this research perspective. It begins by explaining neural networks from a mathematical perspective, explaining all of the theory behind ML, things like back propagation and adversarial networks.
Even non-university affiliated material follows this pattern to some extent. For example, this is taken directly from TensorFlow’s “Quickstart for Beginners”:
If you think I’m cherrypicking confusing language, I invite you to read the whole thing.
If you’re already familiar with the math behind machine learning, or you’re excited about learning it, this approach will work for you. If, however, you primarily want to build things with machine learning, this may not be exactly what you’re looking for.
To use programming as a corollary, this approach is like learning to write code by first learning assembly. Virtually no developer learns like this.
Note: If you somehow did learn to code in assembly, I accept your angry comments, and am impressed that you got a browser to install on whatever obscure Linux distro you’re running.
When you learned to code, you likely did so by writing hello world in a high-level language. Then, as you introduced little bits of complexity to your projects, you learned more and more lower-level programming as needed.
This learning pattern is successful among people who build software because it prioritizes building things—and if you’re more interested in building a recommendation engine than publishing a paper, this is how you should approach learning ML.
How to learn ML by building software
If you’re the type of person who learns best by taking courses, the best resource, and probably the most vocal advocate for this top-down, learn-by-doing approach to ML, is fastai’s Practical Deep Learning For Coders course.
This article’s goal isn’t to be a giant advert for fastai, but suffice to say, its founders (Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas) have put together several courses that teach developers deep learning by having them actually build things, diving into the underlying theory as it pertains to the projects being built. To get a sense for their teaching style, check out this talk from Rachel Thomas:
Alternatively, if you’re the sort of person who learns best by diving in and building things on your own, getting started with machine learning is the same as any other niche of programming. Pick a project that sounds interesting to you—I’ve put together a giant list of beginner-friendly NLP projects here—and jump in.
A good approach for getting familiar with what it’s like to build with ML, assuming you learn this way, would be to:
Identify a goal, like building a text auto-completer or a license plate identifier.
Find a pre-trained model that fits your project—GPT-2 or YOLOv3 would work for the previously mentioned projects, respectively.
If you’re feeling fancy, you can even use a library like gpt-2-simple to fine tune (customize to your own data) your model.
Finally, deploy your model as a microservice.
Once you have a model deployed as an API, you can query it like you would any other web service and build your application around it.
You can actually see a real world application of this process in this project, created by a solo engineer dabbling in ML:
With this approach, you can learn about the different popular model architectures and approaches to machine learning, and what applications they’re suited for. Just as importantly, you’ll learn about ML infrastructure, which is vital to building real products out of models.
Once you can build with machine learning, then learn the theory
If you’re an engineer, you’ve probably implemented some form of authentication before, which means you’ve (hopefully) hashed passwords.
When you set up your password hashing, did you write a custom hashing algorithm? Did you spend weeks studying cryptography? Or did you just use bcrypt?
Similarly, when you built your first web application, did you spend weeks learning about databases? Did you write your own from scratch? Or did you use whatever ORM came with your favorite framework?
This same logic applies to machine learning as well. If you’re the sort of person who likes to build software, start by building software with machine learning, and let tools, pre-trained models, and ML frameworks abstract away the underlying ML theory. Then, if you’re curious or if your project demands more complexity, dig deeper under the hood to see how it all works.

When you set up your password hashing, did you write a custom hashing algorithm? Did you spend weeks studying cryptography? Or did you just use bcrypt? Similarly, when you built your first web application, did you spend weeks learning about databases? Did you write your own from scratch? Or did you use whatever ORM came with your favorite framework? This same logic applies to machine learning as well. If you’re the sort of person who likes to build software, start by building software with machine learning, and let tools, pre-trained models, and ML frameworks abstract away the underlying ML theory. Then, if you’re curious or if your project demands more complexity, dig deeper under the hood to see how it all works.

&lt;p&gt;도널드 맥킨타이어(Donald McIntyre) 이더리움클래식(ETC, 시가총액 38위) 코어 개발자가 공식 채널을 통해 “ETC가 향후 10년 내 7,000달러를 넘어설 것”이라고 전망했다. 이와 관련 그는 7가지 근거를 들었다.&lt;/p&gt;

The MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) is spinning up a multi-year effort dedicated to Bitcoin research and development. The program raised $4 million from prominent backers including CoinShares’ Meltem Demirors, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, among others, as well as corporate entities including Fidelity Digital Assets. It has made the long-term health of the Bitcoin protocol its key area of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next four years, the Bitcoin Software and Security Effort will dedicate resources to Bitcoin Core development, the underlying codebase of the near-trillion-dollar network. MIT researchers will also investigate long-standing questions regarding Bitcoin’s core attributes, like how the stability of the network after the 21 million BTC mining subsidy runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 12-year existence, Bitcoin has proved remarkably robust. The decentralized network has gone down just twice in its history – most recently in 2013. A core group of maintainers patch bugs, ship updates and generally oversee the protocol. This work is primarily funded on the patronage model, with corporations supporting the work of developers, or as a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: Gab, Refuge for the Deplatformed, Hacked for ‘Pretty Much Everything’ Including Trump Data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the Media Lab’s mandate is to help steward this unofficial development process, thereby helping to “reduce bottlenecks in the development ecosystem which might lead to centralization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also: Nic Carter – Bitcoin’s Patronage System Is an Unheralded Strength&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the use of Bitcoin grows, and as it becomes more deeply embedded into our societies, the security of the network must grow and strengthen alongside it. Yet, as a common good, there is no one single Bitcoin protector or guardian to take on this formidable task,” the group wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Daniel Kuhn Mon, March 1, 2021, 1:19 AM·2 min read</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Obesity: Appetite drug could mark ‘new era’ in tackling condition</title><link href="https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/obesity-appetite-drug-could-mark-new-era-in-tackling-condition.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Obesity: Appetite drug could mark ‘new era’ in tackling condition" /><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2021-03-01T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/obesity-appetite-drug-could-mark-new-era-in-tackling-condition</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/obesity-appetite-drug-could-mark-new-era-in-tackling-condition.html">&lt;p&gt;A drug that suppresses appetite has led to some people losing more than a fifth of their body weight, a major international trial shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weekly injection of the drug, semaglutide, was given alongside advice on diet and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted on almost 2,000 people, showed an average 15kg weight loss during the 15-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists said the results could mark a “new era” in treating obesity with even more therapies on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan, from Kent, lost 28kg (four stone), equivalent to more than a fifth of her body weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The drug changed my life and completely altered my approach to food,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said dieting had made her “miserable” but taking the drug was completely different as she was less hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Effortless’
However, now Jan has come off the trial her appetite has returned and she is putting weight back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said: “It felt effortless losing weight while on the trial, but now it has gone back to feeling like a constant battle with food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide will already be familiar to some people who use it as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but this trial looked at giving it at higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesco urged by investors to sell more healthy food
The drug works by hijacking the body’s appetite levels and mimicking a hormone - called GLP1 - that is released after eating a filling meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial gave some people the drug and others a dummy injection, while both groups were given the lifestyle advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed people lost an average of 15kg on semaglutide compared with 2.6kg without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, 32% of people lost a fifth of their body weight with the drug, compared with fewer than 2% on the dummy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘New era’
Prof Rachel Batterham, from UCL and one of the UK researchers, told the BBC News website: “This is a game-changer in the amount of weight loss it causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have spent the last 20 years doing obesity research, up until now we’ve not had an effective treatment for obesity apart from bariatric surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said losing weight would reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and of severe Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is being submitted to drugs regulators so cannot be routinely prescribed. However, Prof Batterham expects the drug would be used initially by specialist weight loss clinics rather than being widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were side-effects to the treatment including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation. And there are five-year studies taking place to see if weight loss can be sustained in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof Sir Stephen O’Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: “The amount of weight loss achieved is greater than that seen with any licensed anti-obesity drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the start of a new era for obesity drug development with the future direction being to achieve levels of weight loss comparable to semaglutide, while having fewer side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Duane Mellor, a dietitian and from Aston Medical School, said: “It is useful to have a potential option to help people lose weight, however we need to acknowledge that weight loss will still need lifestyle change, and that any medication or change in lifestyle can bring potential risks and side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, it is always wise to speak to a health professional before trying to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A drug that suppresses appetite has led to some people losing more than a fifth of their body weight, a major international trial shows.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[python &amp;amp; django] 가상환경 설정하고 장고 설치하기</title><link href="https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/python-django.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[python &amp;amp; django] 가상환경 설정하고 장고 설치하기" /><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2021-03-01T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/python-django</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rulemaker-blog.netlify.app/2021/03/01/python-django.html">&lt;p&gt;가상환경을 설치할 디렉토리로 이동해서 가상환경 설치&lt;/p&gt;
